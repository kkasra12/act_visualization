      "This explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down \n",
      "harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "(AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and \n",

      "prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery, \n",
      "the use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes \n",
      "and pro vide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. Such \n",
      "action is especially needed in high -impact sectors, including climate change, environment and \n",
      "health, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, t he same \n",
      "elements and techniques that power the socio -economic benefits of AI can also bring about \n",
